# Locked Inside
Adds a chance for the facility to become "one-way", making it so you can only enter through the entrance and leave through the fire exits. This can occur whenever you land on a moon and will last for the whole day.
The chance can be configured. The default is 10%.

There is also a setting for a separate chance that can trigger which makes it so you have to enter through a fire exit and leave through the main entrance instead. The default for this is 25%. This can only trigger if the other chance has been triggered. So basically by default this will only happen on 1/40 moons.

I know there are other mods that lock specific entrances and exits already but I wanted to have one that activates at random. That's why I made this.
