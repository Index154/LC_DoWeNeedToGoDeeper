## Known issues
- Multiplayer is untested. This is my first mod so it might be fricked up

## Future ideas
I won't necessarily be adding these. Feel free to comment if you think I should.
- Options for different activation chances per moon
- Options for tying the activation to the selected interior instead of random chance
- Options for only locking the doors during specific times of day
- Probably difficult to implement: A mode where it keeps track of where each player entered and gives them the corresponding exit restriction only until they make it out again
