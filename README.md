Refer to the Thunderstore page for an explanation of the mod's functionality.

## Future ideas
I won't necessarily be adding these. Feel free to comment if you think I should.
- Something to prevent getting stuck with a fire exit that requires a key to progress
- Options for tying the activation to the selected interior instead of random chance
- Options for only locking the doors during specific times of day
- Probably difficult to implement: A mode where it keeps track of where each player entered and gives them the corresponding exit restriction only until they make it out again
